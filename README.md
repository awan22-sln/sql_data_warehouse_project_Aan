# 🏗️ SQL Server Lakehouse Data Warehouse

## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to this repository!
This project showcases how to build a **modern data warehouse using SQL Server**, following clean architecture principles and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement an **end-to-end data warehouse solution** that transforms raw data into analytics-ready datasets to support reporting and data-driven decision making.

---

## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains a complete **data warehouse implementation** built on **SQL Server**.
The project applies **lakehouse concepts** with a **medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** to clearly separate concerns across the data pipeline.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project includes:

* **Bronze Layer**
  Raw data ingestion from source files with minimal transformation.

* **Silver Layer**
  Data cleaning, deduplication, and standardization into trusted business entities.

* **Gold Layer**
  Analytics-ready data modeled using fact and dimension tables.

* **ETL Processes**
  SQL-based ETL pipelines implemented using stored procedures.

* **Data Modeling & Standards**
  Consistent naming conventions, surrogate keys, and technical columns.
